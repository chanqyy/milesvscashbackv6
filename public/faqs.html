    <strong>Why did you choose to split spend across these categories?</strong><br><br>
    <p>Banks gamify credit card spend in many ways, with each bank having their own preferred way of splitting up categories. However, in general there are two broad methods of categorisation, one is through channel of spend, and the other is through type of spend (i.e. dining, shopping). </p>
    <p>I chose channels of spend as my broad categories as that's my preferred method of using my credit cards, given that there's usually less contention whether a transaction classifies as online, mobile contactless, or offline. It's pretty clear-cut. However, type of spend is based on MCC, where it's literally up to merchant to decide what it wants to be classified as (food for thought: does spend at a hotel's restaurant fall under travel or dining?). It's also entirely possible for a merchant to have MCC A on Visa network, but MCC B on MasterCard network.</p>
    <p>Such uncertainty regarding MCCs leads me to prioritise a strategy where cards that award accelerated earn rates based on channels of spend, over types of spend, hence resulting in how I defined attributes within this calculator.</p>

    <strong>If I'm uncertain about my type of spend, how can I gain more clarity?</strong>
    <p>There are multiple ways of checking out what spend category your transaction falls under. Milelion has a good guide <a href="https://milelion.com/2023/11/13/how-to-check-merchant-category-codes-mccs-before-making-a-purchase/">here</a>.</p>

    <strong>Where can I find more resources on cashback and miles credit cards?</strong>
    <p>For credit cards in general, refer to resources such as MoneySmart, Seedly, and Singsaver. <br><br>
      For miles earning in particular, refer to resources such as Milelion and MainlyMiles.</p>
