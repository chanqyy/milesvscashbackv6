                    <strong>Converting offline spend to online spend.</strong> <br>
                    Use Amaze + Citibank Rewards to convert your offline spend to online spend. Simply tap your Amaze card when making purchases at physical retail store, and these transactions can be recharged to your Citibank Rewards card online, thus allowing you to earn 4MPD too. <br>
                    <strong>Keep an eye out for miles expiry and be mindful of the possibility of miles devaluation.</strong> <br>
                    Most banks' points expire within 1-5 years, with KrisFlyer miles expiring in 2 years. A conservative estimate would be 3 years for you to earn sufficient miles to redeem for your trip. However, such a long earn horizon may be unwise as routes may be canned, miles devalued and sometimes, when you finally have enough miles to book, there are no available redemption seats! Hence, the recommendation would be to cap at 2.5 years for your earn horizon. <br>
                    <strong>Popular routes get snapped up within days.</strong> <br>
                    Singapore Airlines releases their redemption inventory opens 355 days before day of travel. For popular routes that you've fixed dates for, try to camp in advance. This is especially so if you plan to redeem for more than one seat. <br>
                    <strong>Consolidate your miles card with 1 bank (as much as possible).</strong> <br>
                    As credit card reward points can only be transferred to KrisFlyer programme in blocks of 10,000 minimally with a conversion fee of ~$25, you may end up with orphan miles that expire prior to conversion if you spread yourself too thin, and pay the banks more fees! Do note that different banks have different reward points pooling rules. Some (e.g. UOB) allows you to pool your miles for conversion, while others (e.g. Citibank) don't. Refer to the Milelion article <a href="https://milelion.com/2023/08/12/which-banks-pool-credit-card-points/" target = "_blank">here</a> for more details.<br>
                    <strong>Accelerate your cashback earn as a New-to-bank (NTB) customer.</strong> <br>
                    NTB customers are typically defined as individuals who have not owned or cancelled a credit card with that particular bank in the last 12 months. <br>
                    Many credit cards run NTB acquisition promos, which offer prizes such as bonus lump sum cashback, iPad, Dyson hairdryers and more.

                    <strong>Checking what category your spend falls under.</strong> <br>
                    If you're using a credit card that rewards accelerated earn rates based on categories, you may wish to check what category (aka MCC) your transaction falls under. Milelion has written a good guide <a href="https://milelion.com/2023/11/13/how-to-check-merchant-category-codes-mccs-before-making-a-purchase/" target = "_blank">here</a>.
